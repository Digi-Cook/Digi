                <h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan over medium heat.<br>
                    - Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.<br>

                    - Add the chopped mixed vegetables and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften but remain crisp.<br>
                    - Add crumbled paneer to the pan and mix well with the vegetables.<br>
                    - Add soy sauce, green chili sauce, vinegar, black pepper powder, and salt. Mix everything thoroughly and cook for a few more minutes. The filling should be well-seasoned and flavorful.<br>
                    - Turn off the heat and let the filling cool down a bit. Add chopped cilantro and mix.

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Assemble the Spring Rolls:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Take a spring roll wrapper and place it on a clean surface in a diamond shape (one corner facing you).<br>
                    - Place a spoonful of the paneer and vegetable filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper.<br>
                    - Fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll it up tightly halfway.<br>
                    - Fold the sides of the wrapper towards the center.<br>
                    - Continue rolling the wrapper upwards, making sure it's tightly wrapped. Use a mixture of all-purpose flour and water to seal the edges of the wrapper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Fry the Spring Rolls:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.<br>
                    - Carefully place the sealed spring rolls into the hot oil, seam side down.<br>
                    - Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides. Make sure to turn them gently for even frying.<br>
                    - Once fried, remove the spring rolls from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Serve:</h3>
